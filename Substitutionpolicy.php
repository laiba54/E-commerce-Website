        <p class="text-xl tracking-widest text-justify ">At Creative Floral House, we understand that sometimes adjustments are necessary to ensure your bouquet is delivered promptly and beautifully. Due to the availability of certain flowers in different regions, occasional substitutions may be required. Rest assured, all items on our website represent the quality and style of products we offer, and any substitutions made will be carefully chosen to maintain the overall look, feel, and value of your arrangement.
             While we strive to adhere to your selected floral arrangement's style, theme, and color scheme, substitutions may be made with flowers of equal or greater value to ensure your satisfaction. In instances where specific keepsake items are included, substitutions may also be necessary, especially during peak seasons and major holidays, to accommodate increased demand.
             For single-flower arrangements, such as all rose bouquets or orchids, we'll do our best to match the flower type specified in your order. However, if necessary, we may substitute with another color to ensure the integrity of the design.
             Rest assured, our team is dedicated to creating a beautiful bouquet that brings joy to both you and your recipient. Thank you for entrusting us with your floral needs.</p>
